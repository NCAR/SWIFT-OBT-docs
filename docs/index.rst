History
-------
SWIFT-OBT is an integrated analysis platform that comprises a number of extensive tropical cyclone (TC) observational processing and analysis capabilities. As of the  v0.1 release in May 2024, SWIFT-OBT now integrates these capabilities into an extensible analysis framework that will be demonstrated in real-time during the 2024 and 2025 hurricane seasons.

The purpose of this documentation is to provide guidance on how to install and use the SWIFT-OBT system in real-time and retrospective settings.
